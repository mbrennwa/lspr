\section*{Calculate power response of a loudspeaker}

Calculate approximate power response of a loudspeaker using SPL response on a sphere around the loudspeaker. The SPL responses $H_{m,n}$ are measured on two orbits as shown in the figure below ($m=1$ for the vertical orbit, $m=2$ for the vertical orbit). There are $N$ equally spaced points on each orbit ($n = 1\ldots N$).

The power response ($PR$) is the sound power summed over the sphere. If $w_n$ is the portion of the sphere surface covered by each point $(m,n)$, the summed power is:

\begin{equation*}
  PR = 10 \log_{10} \left( \sum_{m=1}^{2} \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n |H_{m,n}|^2  \right) 
\end{equation*}

Note: $H_{m,n}$ is the SPL response at point $(m,n)$, in linear units (not dB).
